I wanted to share this Java program that simulates rockets inside and outside of the atmosphere. I implemented a form of Euler's method and simeltaneous numeric integration to approximate the solution to the second order ODE describing motion through an atmosphere. The program also uses the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to model rocket apoapsis outside of earth's atmosphere. This was an independent school project for my AP Computer Science Principles class.
